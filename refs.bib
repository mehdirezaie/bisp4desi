journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The baryon acoustic oscillations are a promising route to the precision measure of the cosmological distance scale and hence the measurement of the time evolution of dark energy. We show that the nonlinear degradation of the acoustic signature in the correlations of low-redshift galaxies is a correctable process. By suitable reconstruction of the linear density field, one can sharpen the acoustic peak in the correlation function or, equivalently, restore the higher harmonics of the oscillations in the power spectrum. With this, one can achieve better measurements of the acoustic scale for a given survey volume. Reconstruction is particularly effective at low redshift, where the nonlinearities are worse but where the dark energy density is highest. At z = 0.3, we find that one can reduce the sample variance error bar on the acoustic scale by at least a factor of 2 and in principle by nearly a factor of 4. We discuss the significant implications our results have for the design of galaxy surveys aimed at measuring the distance scale through the acoustic peak.}

abstract = {The multipole expansion of spatial three-point statistics is introduced as a tool for investigating and displaying configuration dependence. The novel parameterization renders the relation between bispectrum and three-point correlation function especially transparent as a set of two-dimensional Hankel transforms. It is expected on theoretical grounds that three-point statistics can be described accurately with only a few multipoles. In particular, we show that in the weakly nonlinear regime, the multipoles of the reduced bispectrum, Ql, are significant only up to quadrupole. Moreover, the nonlinear bias in the weakly nonlinear regime only affects the monopole order of these statistics. As a consequence, a simple, novel set of estimators can be constructed to constrain galaxy bias. In addition, the quadrupole to dipole ratio is independent of the bias; thus, it becomes a novel diagnostic of the underlying theoretical assumptions: weakly nonlinear gravity and perturbative local bias. To illustrate the use of our approach, we present predictions based on both power-law and cold dark matter models. We show that the presently favored Sloan Digital Sky Survey/Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe concordance model displays strong "baryon bumps" in the Ql's. Finally, we sketch out three practical techniques to estimate these novel quantities: they amount to new, and for the first time edge-corrected, estimators for the bispectrum.}
