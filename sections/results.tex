\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

Glam Section
Plot Glam with and without BAO measurements.
Describe Molino's covariance and put some justification. 1 Gpc cub.
Reference Jayashree's paper that the template works well for a range of redshifts. make a plot for sigma alpha vs kmax, with and without nuisance parameters.

Sec 3. BAO is DESI samples. Analyse Abacus mocks with template from Jayashree. 

Sec 4. BAO detection level. How well we can fit BAO with a smooth function. Mean Glam' with and without BAO as model 1 and 2, and mean Glam with BAO as data. Chi2 vs alpha.
