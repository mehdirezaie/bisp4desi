We use simulations with and without BAO signal to assess the possibility of extracting more information from higher order statistics. We measure the BAO constraints from the power spectrum and the bispectrum of DESI-like LRG tracers. We show that the BAO signal in the bispectrum has a potential of significantly improving the distance constraints by X\% compared to the power spectrum alone analysis. The improvement seems to be stable when we marginalize over possible theoretical systematics. We validate our results on simulations with and without BAO for a range of redshifts. We measure isotropic BAO from the AbacusSummit simulations that are designed to replicate the DESI BGS, LRG, ELG, and QSO samples. We find that, in the absence of additional systematic effects we are able to constrain the distance scale with the precision of xxx per cent, xxx per cent, and xxx percent respectively for the BGS, LRG, and ELG samples. Whereas, the forecasted BAO constraints for the power spectrum only are xxx, xxx, and xxx percent respectively.
