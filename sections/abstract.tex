We use \texttt{AbacusSummit} simulations to explore the possibility of measuring the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation signal from the bispectrum of DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) galaxies. We measure isotropic BAO from mock galaxy catalogs designed to replicate the various DESI samples. We use several methods to separate the BAO signal from the bispectrum, estimate the covariance of the measurements, and fit the distance scale to it. We show that the BAO signal in the bispectrum can significantly improve the distance constraints compared to the power spectrum alone analysis. \textcolor{red}{We will quote some numbers here once we have stable results}.
