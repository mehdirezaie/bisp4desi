\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

DESI is a great experiment. We need higher order statistics to extract more information. Reconstruction techniques can improve the precision, but the amount of information is limited by cosmic variance. Possible ways to improve is to go higher order statistics. 

Cite Lado's paper that if bispectrum used as a standard ruler, a significant improvement is distance scale can be achieved. Much better than the standard reconstruction. Difficult to model the full bispectrum though. In this paper, we would like to do a standard ruler analysis of bispectrum BAO with different DESI-like tracers. 

We find a factor of X improvement, and what happens at different redshifts. Worse for QSO probably, because of high shotnoise and less bispectrum clustering at higher redshifts.
