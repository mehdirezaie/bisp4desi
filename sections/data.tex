Molino (15,000 Mocks): 
$\Omega_{Îœ}$=0.32, $\sigma$8=0.834,  Volume ~ 1 Gpc/h3 
Galaxy catalogs from the Quijote N-body simulations (Villaescusa-Navarro et al.2020) with the standard Halo Occupation Distribution model from Zheng et al. (2007). HOD parameters are based on high luminosity SDSS samples. More at changhoonhahn.github.io/molino

And two other series of mocks provided by our DESI collaborators:
GLAM (1,000 Mocks)

Abacus (25 mocks)


Fig. \ref{fig:data} shows the mean bispectrum (left) and the mean power spectrum (right) for the GLAM and ABACUS simulations, relative to the spectra without the BAO signal, which is simulation-based for the GLAM realizations and theory-based for the ABACUS.
